## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- ENV file missing: Since this is a mockup project, environment variables are not used. In a real project, all links would be stored in an .env file.

- Idle timer logic: In a real project, the idle logout logic should be handled in the backend.

- User menu UI issue: Clicking on the user icon in desktop mode causes all items to shift unexpectedly.

- Bet re-rendering issue: When placing bets rapidly, all bets re-render instead of smoothly updating.

- Bet cancellation logic: The logic is implemented, but the cancellation button is not yet fully functional.

- Pagination showing 1 of 0 pages result, there should be only page without off

- Transaction and Betting empty pages should display CTA to start betting instead of default error message.

- Missing proper UI/UX for Footer

- In Transactions card there is a bug -> type: BET it should be Lost

- User balance should display euro sign instead if words

- Recent bets should have CTA as well instead of not bets message for better UX
