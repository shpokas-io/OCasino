# üöÄ Casino Wallet System - Frontend

This is a **casino-style wallet system app** that allows users to **register, log in, place bets, manage transactions, view their balance, and cancel bets**. It features a fully responsive UI, protected routes, and Redux state management.

- For this project, the mission was to create a fully functioning frontend with clean code, a solid folder structure, and as many features as possible.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **ENV file missing**: Since this is a mockup project, environment variables are not used. In a real project, all links would be stored in an `.env` file.
- **Idle timer logic**: In a real project, the idle logout logic should be handled in the backend.
- **User menu UI issue**: Clicking on the user icon in desktop mode causes all items to shift unexpectedly.
- **Bet re-rendering issue**: When placing bets rapidly, all bets re-render instead of smoothly updating.
- **Bet cancellation logic**: The logic is implemented, but the cancellation button is not yet fully functional.
- **Pagination issue**: Pagination shows `1 of 0` pages; there should only be one page without an incorrect offset.
- **Empty state improvements**: Transaction and betting empty pages should display a CTA to start betting instead of a default error message.
- **Missing UI/UX for Footer**: Needs proper design and implementation.
- **Transaction card bug**: Type `BET` should display as `Lost`.
- **User balance formatting**: Should display a euro sign (‚Ç¨) instead of words.
- **Recent bets improvement**: Should include a CTA instead of a `no bets` message for better UX.
- **Dark/Light mode issue**: Implemented but not working correctly. The biggest issue is that it was not started from a React hook for dark mode, which would have made it much easier. A note for future projects.
- **Bets page re-rendering**: Once a user clicks spin, a re-render happens. Need a solution to fix this.
